# Graphics-project
A small project for graphics, in order to rotate and design different figures.
```
This project was done as a part of graphics and management project in College of Engineering, Pune.

```
This uses Canvas library from android in order to rotate figures and draw different diagrams using android app. On installing the application, you can chose to draw figues and rotate them and observe how they look from differnt angles.

This supports line and 2D figures. 

This was a fun interesting project. And it's a fun application for kids.
